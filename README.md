# Auto Reload Images - Blender addon

Handy automatic reload for Image Textures

Just a little handy addon, adding two button in the info header :
- refresh all images of the blend file
- use a timer to fetch modified image file and reload them if needed

Both of these operations will update viewport and screen accordingly to new image files

Setup the timer in the user prefs addon, it will compare modification time of each image files every "n" seconds. If one has changed, it will be reload !

Enjoy !
